# Enterprise-Grade Logistics Management System

A robust, scalable, and fault-tolerant logistics management system built with modern enterprise technologies for high-performance business operations.

## Technologies

- **Backend**: Java 17, Spring Boot 3.2
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15
- **Containerization**: Docker, Docker Compose
- **Resilience**: Resilience4j
- **Concurrency**: Java MultiThreading
- **Architecture**: Microservice Architecture
- **Messaging**: Apache Kafka
- **Design Pattern**: Event-Driven Architecture
- **Security**: Spring Security with OAuth2/JWT

## System Architecture

The system follows a microservice architecture pattern, with the following core services:

- **API Gateway**: Entry point for all client requests with routing, load balancing, and security enforcement
- **User Service**: Creates and manages user accounts.
- **User Profile Service**: Creates and manages user profiles.
- **Auth Service**: Handles authentication and authorization
- **Order Service**: Manages customer orders and order processing workflow
- **Inventory Service**: Tracks product inventory across warehouses
- **Shipping Service**: Coordinates package delivery and tracking
- **Driver Assignment Service**: Custom Logic to assign drivers to shipments.
- **Warehouse Service**: Manages warehouse operations and optimization
- **Analytics Service**: Provides business intelligence and reporting
- **Notification Service**: Handles all system notifications via various channels

Each service operates independently with its own database schema and communicates through asynchronous event-driven messaging via Kafka.

## Key Features

- **High Availability**: Designed for 99.99% uptime with no single point of failure
- **Horizontal Scalability**: Services can be scaled independently based on demand
- **Fault Tolerance**: Circuit breakers, bulkheads, and retries via Resilience4j
- **Real-time Event Processing**: Event-driven architecture for immediate data consistency
- **Advanced Security**: Role-based access control with OAuth2/JWT authentication
- **Performance Optimization**: Multi-threading for computationally intensive operations
- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Metrics, logging, and tracing integration

## Prerequisites

- JDK 17+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- PostgreSQL 15
- Apache Kafka
- Maven 3.8+

## Installation and Setup

### Local Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/enterprise-grade-logistics-management-system.git
cd enterprise-grade-logistics-management-system
```

2. Start the infrastructure services using Docker Compose:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-infra.yml up -d
```

3. Build all microservices:
```bash
./mvnw clean package -DskipTests
```

4. Start all services:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Configuration

Each microservice contains its own configuration in `src/main/resources/application.yml`. Common configuration properties include:

- Database connection settings
- Kafka broker details
- Security configuration
- Resilience4j circuit breaker settings
- Logging levels

Environment-specific configurations are maintained in separate profiles (dev, test, prod).

## API Documentation

API documentation is automatically generated using SpringDoc OpenAPI and available at:

```
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
```

The system exposes RESTful APIs with consistent patterns for all services.

## Security

The system implements multiple layers of security:

- API Gateway level authentication/authorization
- Service-to-service communication secured with mTLS
- Database encryption for sensitive data
- HTTPS for all external communications
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Regular security scanning integrated in CI/CD

## Performance and Scalability

- Asynchronous processing for non-blocking operations
- Connection pooling for database operations
- Caching strategies using Redis
- Horizontal scaling of services under load
- Database query optimization and indexing

## Resilience Patterns

The system implements the following resilience patterns using Resilience4j:

- **Circuit Breaker**: Prevents cascading failures
- **Retry**: Automatically retries failed operations with exponential backoff
- **Bulkhead**: Isolates failures to prevent system-wide impact
- **Rate Limiter**: Protects services from overload
- **Cache**: Reduces repeated expensive operations
- **Time Limiter**: Sets timeout for operations

## Deployment

The system supports multiple deployment options:

### Docker Deployment

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-prod.yml up -d
```

### Cloud: AWS
```bash
AWS, EC2, RDS, Load Balancer
```



## Testing

The codebase includes:

- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for service interactions
- End-to-end tests simulating real-world scenarios
- Performance tests for load testing and benchmarking

Run the test suite with:

```bash
./mvnw clean verify
```
